# Inconvenient Login Competition

Your task is to create the absolute worst, most inconvenient login page EVER. You have until the end of the GBM to modify this basic login and submit a Pages link to your inconvenient login. Scoring will be based on ANGER, HUMOR, and BONUS for anything extra such as not being buggy (unless intended) or incorporating [this](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77300333?v=4) image into your design.

# How to get started

Install git: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install node: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

In order to start, you first need to Fork this repository. To do that, click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. You can use the command `git clone <forked-repo-url>` to clone your fork and work with it in your IDE.

# How to test

The first step to testing is locating your project directory. There is a terminal in most IDEs that you can use to run commands directly in whatever directory you are working on, or you can locate your project in a separate terminal. You need to run/enter `npm install` in your terminal before doing any testing. In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Built into this project are also the commands `npm run eject`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`, but all you really need is `npm start` in order to test your login page with live updates.
